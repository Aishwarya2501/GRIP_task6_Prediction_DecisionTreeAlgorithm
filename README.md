# GRIP TASK #6 - Data Science and Bussiness Analytics
# Prediction Using Decision Tree Algorithm 

1. Decision trees are easy to interpret and visualize.
2. It can easily capture Non-linear patterns and require less Data cleaning.
3. It doesnâ€™t require any normalization and can be applied in both regression and classification problems.
- Here we have taken iris_dataset which has 'SepalLengthCm', 'SepalWidthCm', 'PetalLengthCm', 'PetalWidthCm','Species' features(target class='Species').
We can either load dataset from scikit_learn or else download the dataset on pc.

- our **objective** is to predict whether the new Iris flower falls in the  category that is one among **'Setosa',  'Virginica' ,'Versicolor'.**

**Finally, the accuracy is 1.00 as dataset is very small and Decision trees are powerful,
it is simple for the model to break down into patterns and it easily learns these patterns and classifies even the unseen data with a 100% accuracy.**
